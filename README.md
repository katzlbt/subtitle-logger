# subtitle-logger

Log subtitles on a web stream-player to read them slowly at your own pace, especially if they appear too short to read. Currently this works only for the WeTV and Youku player, but I will add viki and crunchy if that is possible later.

# Usage

   1. Open the JS developer console of your web-wrowser when watching a series on wetv.vip, www.viki.com or www.youku.tv
   2. Paste the content of SubtitleLogger.js as text in the console-tab and hit enter.
   3. The log should appear on the bottom left
   4. You can close the developer section. Repeat after reloading/opening the web-page again.
