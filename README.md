# subtitle-logger

Log subtitles on a web stream-player to read them slowly at your own pace, especially if they appear too short to read. Currently this works only for the WeTV player at wetv.vip, but I will add youku and viki if that is possible later.

# Usage

   1. Open the JS developer console of your web-wrowser when watching a series on wetv.vip/en/play
   2. Paste the whole file in the console-tab and hit enter.
   3. The log should appear on the bottom left
   4. You can close the developer section

# Supported Players
    
    - wetv.vip/en/play (tested in Chrome 2025-12)
    
Currently this only works on wetv stream player until they change how it works.
